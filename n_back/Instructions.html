    On the following page you will see a sequence comprised of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    Each number is shown for {{C.trialDuration}} milliseconds; then nothing is shown for {{C.intertrialDuration}} milliseconds, before
    the next number appears and so on. The sequence has a length of {{length}} numbers in total.
</p>
<p>
    Your task is to press the space bar whenever the current number
    is exactly the same as the number that was shown {{C.N}} numbers before.
       You have time to react until the number disappears after {{C.trialDuration}} milliseconds.
</p>
<p>
    Both pressing the space bar when the number does not match, or failing to press it when it does count as an error.
    &#10003; is briefly shown to indicate an error; whenever you correctly press space, &#10007; appears instead.
